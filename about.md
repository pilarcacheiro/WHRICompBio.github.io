Researchers meet to discuss current topics, journal articles, and ideas in computational biology and bioinformatics.

 * <b>Time:</b> Fridays, 2pm

 * <b>Place:</b> biopharmacology meeting room (John Vane Science Centre, 1st floor)



### Meeting structure

 * The leader of each meeting chooses a recent article and distributes a link (or a pdf) to the group.

 * The group reads the article ahead of the meeting.

 * The leader initiates and moderates the discussion during the meeting, with input from the entire group.


### Scheduling

 * The leader for each meeting is determined by the schedule.

 * It is the scheduled person's responsibility to select the article and to lead the discussion.

 * In case of a scheduling conflict, the schedule can be updated via swaps. 

   * If someone cannot be present at their scheduled time, they can agree with another group member to change time slots.

   * If someone who is not yet on the schedule wants to lead a discussion, they can arrange to take over an existing time slot.

   * If there is a conflict that affects a large portion of the group (e.g. bank holiday, conference), a meeting slot can be removed from the schedule, or the schedule can be pushed down, as needed (after discussion).
